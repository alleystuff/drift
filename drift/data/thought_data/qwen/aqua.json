Running speed of '$A$', $S_A$:  \\n     $$ S_{A} = \\\\dfrac{Distance~by~which~the~race~is~run}{Time~taken~to~complete~it} =~ \\\\dfrac{1000~metres}{4.5~minutes}~=~~\\\\approx\\\\dfrac{1000}{4.5}*sec^{-1}\\n      ~= ~~222.22* sec^{-1}. $$  \\n\\nSimilarly calculating for \\\"$B$\\\", whose overall time was mentioned explicitly as **five full minutes**, hence;\\n    \\nRunning speed of '$B'$,$ S_B$, becomes simply :\\n     \\n       $$ S_{B} = \\\\dfrac{distance}{total-time},~\\n          S_{B} = \\\\dfrac{1000 metres}{5mins}=\\n           \\u2248\\u2248\\u223c \\\\dfrac{1000}{5}*seconds^{-1} =\\n            \\u223c?=\\uff5e? ??. $$\\n\\nTherefore simplifying yields:  \\n  \\n        $$ S_B

So indeed, \\u201cA\\u201d needs less time i.e., he\\u2019ll beat Bob even giving him some lead off distance!\\n\\n**Step 2**: Determine Lead-off Distance (\\u201cStart\\u201d) Needed For Fair Competition\\n  \\nSince `A` takes fewer units-of-time-to-complete-the-race-than-B does, there must exist certain meter-distance (`x`) ahead from Start Line assigned uniquely-to-A, enabling no premature win! We use formula linking linear motion & velocity concepts viz.: Total-Distance-travelled-over-Time equals Velocity-multiplication-product !\\n\\nSo, solving geometrically;\\n\\nTotal Race Length = L ; Given L = 1Kilo-meter = [1000M]; Suppose X represents distance gap\", 0]]",

successive integers whose differences form consistent cycles under repeated application of basic arithmetic progressions.\\n\\n**Step 2**: Simplify Using Modular Arithmetic Direct Approach   \\nGiven

Specifically look closely not merely additive increments themselves but cumulative effects thereof across full domain considered.\\n\\n**Step 3 Apply Summative Principles Within Constraints**\\nWe recognize that adding multiple identical units repeatedly creates predictable resultant forms allowing easy extraction of common factor structures reducing complexity substantially compared handling raw data points independently.

Once we know the cost price, we'll calculate the required selling price such that there would be a loss equivalent to losing 5%.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s break down our approach systematically:\\n\\n### Step-by-step Thought Process\\n\\n#### Determine Cost Price (\\\\(CP\\\\))\\nGiven that selling the house resulted in gain equal to one-eighth of the cost,\\n\\\\[ SP_{gain}= CP + \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{8}\\\\right)\\\\cdot CP \\\\]\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n\\\\[ RS\\\\.45000= CP+\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{8}\\\\right)\\\\cdot CP \\\\]\\n\\nThis simplifies to finding \\\\(CP\\\\) where:\\n\\n\\\\[RS .45000=\\\\ left[\\\\left(1+\\\\dfrac {1}{8}\\\\right)\\\\ right]\\\\cdot CP \\\\\\\\\\n\\n\\\\[ RS .45000=\\\\ dfrac {9}{8}\\\\cdot CP\\\\\\\\  \\n\\nNow solving for \\\\(CP,\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\[ CP=\\\\dfrac{(Rs\\\\:45000)*\\\\(8)}{9}\\\\\\\\  \\n\\\\[ CP=(Rs\\\\:45000*\\\\dfrac{8}{9}) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\[ CP=R\\\\sideset{}^{ }_{s}(40000).\\n\\nTherefore, the actual cost price without any gains should ideally remain $R\\\\$4000$ since initial earnings were due to markup over costs alone here leading us directly towards determining fair value basis.\\n\\nNext consider desired condition requiring Loss Percentage being exactly negative five percent (-5%) implying Selling Price ($SP\\\\_loss)$ needs adjustment reflecting said reduction off base cost i.e., $(CP-RS.$4000). Thus applying formula again but now aiming specifically toward achieving targeted decrease instead;\\n\\nLoss % Formula applied gives us needed adjusted Sale Value; henceforth calculating requisite resultant selling price corresponding precisely meeting specified criteria necessitating precise subtraction proportional to stated percentage yielding definitive solution within constraints provided thereby concluding logical pathway forward through systematic analysis laid forth hereinabove!\", \"Let \\\\( O \\\\) represent the actual cost/outlay of purchasing the house.
