        "question":"PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy?",
        "thought":"Our study demonstrates no difference in PC detection rate at repeat biopsy between patients with flu or si-PSA levels. PSA Slope, PSAV and PSADT were not found helpful tools in cancer detection."

        "question":"Improvements in survival of gynaecological cancer in the Anglia region of England: are these an effect of centralisation of care and use of multidisciplinary management?",
        "thought":"The adoption of the 1999 guidance on gynaecological cancer, which included multidisciplinary case management and centralisation of surgery, resulted in a marked step-change improvement in survival of gynaecological cancer in an area of eastern England in 2000."

        "question":"Household and food shopping environments: do they play a role in socioeconomic inequalities in fruit and vegetable consumption?",
        "thought":"Improving access to FV in the household and food shopping environments will only make a small contribution to improving population consumption levels, and may only have a limited effect in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in their consumption."

        "question":"Can we ease the financial burden of colonoscopy?",
        "thought":"Endoscopists within a tertiary care setting can accurately predict diminutive polyp histology and confer an appropriate surveillance interval with an associated financial benefit to the healthcare system. However, limitations to its application in the community setting exist, which may improve with further training and high-definition colonoscopes."

        "question":"Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): a role for polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes?",
        "thought":"We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN."

        "question":"Should tumor depth be included in prognostication of soft tissue sarcoma?",
        "thought":"Most of the prognostic value of tumor depth in soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity or trunk wall can be explained by the association between tumor size and depth."

        "question":"Do elderly patients benefit from surgery in addition to radiotherapy for treatment of metastatic spinal cord compression?",
        "thought":"Elderly patients with MSCC did not benefit from surgery in addition to radiotherapy regarding functional outcome, local control of MSCC, or survival."
