Superficial thrombophlebitis and pain on injection may occur --> Pain can be reduced by using larger vein and injecting lidocaine just before etomidate.Pharmacology"""

        "thought":"""
        Nitroglycerine and other nitrates act by dilating veins more than arteries. 
        This results in peripheral pooling of blood which leads decreased venous return. 
        So the preload is reduced and eventually, decreased cardiac work.In variant angina - nitrates work by dilating the large coronary vessels.Mechanism of action of other antianginal drugsBeta blockers - they decrease heart rate, inotropic state and mean BP. This results in reduced cardiac work.Calcium channel blockers - it causes smooth muscle (vascular) relaxation and negative chronotropic, inotropic and dromotropic actionK+ channel openers - e.g., nicorandil. It causes smooth muscle relaxation.Dipyridamole - prevents uptake and degradation of adenosine. Adenosine is a vasodilator.Trimetazidine - it improves myocardial glucose utilization through inhibition of fatty acid metabolism (LC3- KAT inhibitor)Ranolazine - it inhibits late I current (funny current inhibitor). It also inhibits LC3- KAT.Notes on NitratesMOA - it is more venodilator than arteriolar dilator.Short acting - GlyceryltrinitrateNitroglycerineLong acting - Isosorbide dinitrate (short acting if sublingual)Isosorbide mononitrateAdverse effects- Headache Flushing, weakness, palpitation Methhemoglobinaemia RashesTolerance to the drug occurs if the drug is continuously present in the body.All except Isosorbide mononitrate undergo extensive firstpass metabolism in liver."""

        It is chracterised by repeatition of thoughts, speech or brief behavioural sequences without a sense of incompletion and not as a preventive or a corrective measure. 
        This implies clearly that it is carried out without any purpose.

        Deprivation of decent living standards (P3) HPI-2 also considers a fouh dimension, social exclusion, measured with the long-term unemployment rate (P4), that is the percentage of those unemployed for 12 months or over compared to the total work force (the sum of those working and those seeking a job).

        "thought":"""
        Lidocaine has been the drug used most frequently for intravenous regional anesthesia. Prilocaine, mepivacaine, chloroprocaine, procaine and etidocaine have also been used successfully. Intravenous regional anesthesia or Bier's block involves the intravenous administration of a local anesthetic into a tourniquet- occluded limb. It is used to provide anesthesia for sho surgical procedures (<90 minutes) on the limbs. Note : Bupivacaine and its congeners is not used for Biers block. It is the most cardiotoxic local anesthetic. 
        Accidental early deflation of the tourniquet can lead to massive systemic doses of bupivacaine resulting in cardiac arrhythmias and cardiovascular collapse.
