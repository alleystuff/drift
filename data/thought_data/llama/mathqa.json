it will become\\n\\n((3*25)/(3+2))   litres of Liquid-P & ((2*25)/(3+2))    litres of Liquid-Q.\\n\\nSo here   \\n       LP=(45/5)\\n      And     LQ =(50/5)\\n\\nNow since our aim is to get the final mix as 5::4 or 20::16 i.e., after adding some more 'a' units of liqud-q into existing mixture its proportion becomes :\\n(Liquids-p):(New Quantity Of-Liquid-q)=(original-quantity-of-(liqudp):new-total-volume)\\n\\n\\nThen according to above expression,\\n(45/5) :(55+a)=(Original Lpq)+(Added-a)\\n\\n\\n\\nIn other words,we want to achieve this Ratio :\\n\\n(45/(47+(125/a)))\\n\\nTo\", \"Given that there are currently 25 liters of the mixture made from liquid p and liquid q in the ratio 3:2, we'll start solving the problem using algebraic equations.\\n\\nFirstly, express the quantities of Liquid P and Liquid Q based on the original ratio:\\n\\n\\nLP = (3/5) \\u00d7 25\\nLQ = (2/5) \\u00d7 25\\n\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\n\\nLP = 15\\nLQ = 10\\n\\n\\nOur goal now is to change the ratio between these amounts such that they match 5:4 instead of the present 3:2.\\n\\n\\nAssume \\\"a\\\" additional liters of Liquid Q would help us reach the desired outcome.\\n\\n\\nWhen we add those extra gallons of liquid Q, we obtain:\\n\\n\\n\\nFinal_LiQuid_P = Original_LP = 15\\nFinal_LiQuid_Q = Old_Liq_u_id_q + Added_a = 10 +
